# PokeBuilder

This is just a small React project I made to practice and getter better at the basics of react.

Its primary functionality is to make Pokemon teams in any way you want, from 6 different regions. 
Once picked, you can plan out what moves you want your team to have. 

This project uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) 

#### Note 
This API does not have data yet for the Galar region
