Welcome to the Poke-Builder! 

This is just a small React project I made to practice and getter better at the basics of react.

Its primary functionality is to make Pokemon teams in any way you want, from 6 different regions (So far). 
Once picked, it will display each Pokemons typings. 

Features I plan to include is to save and customize teams with movesets, stats, etc. 

This project uses the <a href='https://pokeapi.co/'>PokeAPI</a>
